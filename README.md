## Interactive_maps

Making some tests of how we can create simple maps with `Leaflet` javascript library

1. Just add the map
2. Create and add a marker
3. add a shapefile

    a. First transform the `shapefile` to a `geoJSON` so we can add it to the map
    
    
**--- To do ---**

- add legend, layer panel?? and scale to the map
- add the option to change the base map
- add maybe another dataset and change how it is visualised
